      "Grave of the Fireflies is a 1988 Japanese animated war drama film written and directed by Isao Takahata, based on the semi-autobiographical short story by Akiyuki Nosaka. Set during the final months of World War II, the film tells the story of Seita and his younger sister Setsuko as they struggle to survive following the firebombing of Kobe. The film presents a realistic and unsentimental portrayal of civilian suffering during wartime, focusing on themes of loss, starvation, and social isolation. Unlike many animated films, it avoids fantasy elements entirely and depicts historical events with emotional restraint. Grave of the Fireflies is widely regarded as one of the most powerful anti-war films ever made and is frequently cited in discussions of animation as a serious storytelling medium.",

      "Porco Rosso is a 1992 Japanese animated adventure film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Set in the Adriatic Sea during the interwar period, the film follows Porco Rosso, a former Italian World War I fighter pilot who has been mysteriously transformed into an anthropomorphic pig. Now living as a freelance bounty hunter, he protects ships from air pirates while avoiding the rise of fascism in Italy.

The film reflects Miyazaki’s fascination with aviation and European history, while also portraying the psychological effects of war. Porco Rosso was originally conceived as a short film but expanded into a full-length feature due to its thematic depth.",
